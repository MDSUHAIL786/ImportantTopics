The Proxy Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder object for another object to control its access.
 In this pattern, the proxy class acts as an intermediary between the client and the real object, and forwards requests from the client to the real object while performing
 additional actions before or after the request.

 The benefits of using the Proxy Design Pattern include:

 It provides a level of indirection between the client and the real object, which can help to improve performance and reduce memory usage.

 It allows you to add functionality to an object without modifying its existing code.

 It allows you to control access to an object by restricting or granting access to certain clients.

 It allows you to create objects on demand, which can help to reduce startup time and improve overall performance.
