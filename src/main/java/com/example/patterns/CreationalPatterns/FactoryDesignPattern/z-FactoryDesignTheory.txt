The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects
in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. In other words,
it allows for the creation of objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

The Factory Method pattern is useful when you want to delegate object creation to subclasses, while still
ensuring that the superclass controls the object creation process. This makes it easy to add new types of
objects to the system, without having to modify existing code.

when there is any requirement where we have to decide the call of a class at runtime in this situation we follow
this design.


---------steps to be followed--------------
1. create a folder for particular task
2. create interface that have some required methods
3. create impl folder and make implementation classes on the basis of requirement
4. create factory folder and create a class which decide or return the object/instance of class that called at
   runtime.
