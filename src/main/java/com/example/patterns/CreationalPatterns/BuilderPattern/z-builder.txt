The Builder Pattern is a design pattern in software development that allows you to create complex
objects step-by-step.

The builder pattern involves creating a builder class that has methods for setting different properties
of an object. You can then chain these methods together to set multiple properties at once. Once you've
set all the properties, you can call a build() method to create the final object.

The benefit of using the builder pattern is that it allows you to create complex objects without having
to pass a large number of arguments to a constructor and can set any manner. Instead, you can use a fluent API to set properties
in a more readable and understandable way.
