this is creational design pattern which is similar to factory method only difference is that it is
factory of factories.

means like factory method return object of class on the basis of condition similarly abstract factory
pattern return object of factory on the basis of condition.

let's understand by example:

suppose we have lots of cars like BMW, AUDI, Swift, Hyundai, Alto, Bugatti etc.
Now we need to make object of these cars on basis of condition.
1.all these cars classes implements a vehicle interface

2.In factory folder/directory we have two factories classes one is return luxury car object like BMW,
Audi etc. And other is return ordinary car object like swift, alto, hyundai etc

3.In abstractFactory folder we have a class that return the object of factories created in step-2 on
the basis of condition.
