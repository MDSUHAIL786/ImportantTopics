Note: A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child class).
 The class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent class).



(Gang of Four) GoF Design Patterns are divided into three categories:

1.Creational: The design patterns that deal with the creation of an object.

      ->Singleton Pattern
      ->Factory Method Pattern
      ->Abstract Factory Pattern
      ->Builder Pattern
      ->Prototype Pattern

2.Structural: The design patterns in this category deals with the class structure such as Inheritance and Composition.
              Structural design patterns deal with object composition, trying to define how objects and classes
              can be combined to form larger structures.

              The following are some of the sub-patterns of structural design patterns:
              ->Adapter Pattern
              ->Bridge Pattern
              ->Composite Pattern
              ->Decorator Pattern
              ->Facade Pattern
              ->Flyweight Pattern
              ->Proxy Pattern

3.Behavioral: This type of design patterns provide solution for the better interaction between objects, how to provide lose coupling, and
              flexibility to extend easily in future.
              Behavioral design patterns deal with object interactions, trying to define how objects and classes can communicate with each
              other to form larger systems.
        The following are some of the sub-patterns of behavioral design patterns:
        ->Chain of Responsibility Pattern
        ->Command Pattern
        ->Interpreter Pattern
        ->Iterator Pattern
        ->Mediator Pattern
        ->Memento Pattern
        ->Observer Pattern
        ->State Pattern
        ->Strategy Pattern
        ->Template Method Pattern
        ->Visitor Pattern
